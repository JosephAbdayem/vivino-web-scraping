## 🔎 What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from web pages. It collects data from web pages and stores it in a database or a structured format, such as an Excel spreadsheet.

## 🍇 What is Vivino?

Vivino is a comprehensive wine website that enables users to search, rate, compare, and purchase wines online. The site contains information on thousands of wines, including prices, ratings, regions, and more.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to create an Excel spreadsheet containing detailed information about wines available on Vivino. Each wine’s data will be extracted from its respective webpage using web scraping.

## 🛠 Methodology

To achieve the project’s objective, I will use web scraping techniques to extract data from each wine page on Vivino. This data will then be stored in an organized Excel spreadsheet.

Additionally, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) will be employed to automate data collection from each wine page. VBA is a programming language commonly used with Microsoft Excel to write macros and automate tasks.

## 📊 Expected Results

Upon completion, this project will produce an Excel spreadsheet with comprehensive information on wines available on Vivino. This Excel sheet will include wine name, price, rating, region, and other relevant details, offering a structured view for easy access and comparison.
